# Assignment 1 – Custom Object Detection (VOC 2012)

## Dataset
PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset filtered to 5 object classes.

## Model
A custom CNN-based detector trained entirely from scratch.

## Training
- Adam optimizer
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Input size: 224×224
- No pre-trained weights

## Evaluation
IoU-based correctness and classification accuracy were evaluated.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental understanding of object detection
pipelines, dataset handling, and training from scratch.
